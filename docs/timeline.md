# Timeline Mode

Optional toggle on the feed.

---

## Behavior

```
Feed view  <->  Timeline view
```

- **Feed view** (default): all items in reverse-chronological order.
- **Timeline view**: items grouped by year (2026, 2025, earlier).

---

## Rules

- Timeline doubles as a CV / career overview.
- Toggle is a simple button in the feed header.
- Both views share the same data source (content/seed.json).
- Years are derived from the `timestamp` field.
