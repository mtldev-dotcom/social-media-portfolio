# Feed Model

The site uses a **feed-first** mental model.

---

## Rules

- Everything appears in one chronological feed.
- No "pages" in the traditional sense.
- Filters are optional views, not navigation.
- Feed is the homepage.

---

## Implications

- The homepage renders all content types in a single stream, newest first.
- Navigation items like "Notes" or "Lab" are filtered views of the same underlying content.
- The About page is the only true "static" page — a snapshot, not a feed.
- Timeline mode (Phase 5) is an alternate grouping of the same feed data.
