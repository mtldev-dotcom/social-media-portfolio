# Site Vision

This site is a living personal media page.
It documents what I build, think about, experiment with, and abandon.

It is not a business site.
It is not a sales funnel.
It is allowed to be unfinished, playful, and evolving.

## Positioning

- Personal portfolio / CV / storyboard / blog
- Audience: friends, peers, curious builders
- Goal: signal taste, thinking, experimentation
- No selling, no funnels, no pressure
- Business lives at `aiaa.dev`
