# Site Vision

This site is a **professional personal blog** — a living personal media page.
It documents what I build, think about, experiment with, and abandon.
Content is managed in Payload CMS (posts, notes, experiments) with native comments.

It is not a business site.
It is not a sales funnel.
It is allowed to be unfinished, playful, and evolving.

- Personal blog / CV / storyboard
- Audience: friends, peers, curious builders
- Goal: signal taste, thinking, experimentation
- No selling, no funnels, no pressure
